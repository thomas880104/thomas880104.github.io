Drop an object from height \\(h_0\\). After t seconds, height \\(h(t) = h_0 − 16t^2\\). Deposit $1000 in a checking account, continuously compounding at 3%. At time t, it’s worth $ \\(1000e^{0.03t}\\). 8.1.1.2 Probabilistic Models — Involve uncertainty How much snow will fall tomorrow? Will IBM make a profit this year? Should I buy a call or put option? Can I win in blackjack if I use a certain strategy? What is the cost-effectiveness of a new drug? Which horse will win the Kentucky Derby? 8.1.2 Some Cool Examples Birthday Problem — Assume all 365 days have equal probability of being a person’s birthday (ignore freaks born on Feb. 29). Then. . . If there are 23 students in a class, the odds are better than 50–50 that there will be a match. If there are 50 students, the probability is about 97%! Monopoly — In the long run, the property having the highest probability of being landed on is Illinois Ave. Stock Market — Monkeys randomly selecting stocks could have outperformed most market analysts during the past year. Poker — Pick 5 cards from a standard deck. Then P(exactly 2 pairs) ≈ 0.0475, P(full house) ≈ 0.00144, P(flush) ≈ 0.00198. A couple has two kids and at least one is a boy. What’s the probability that BOTH are boys? Possibilities: GG, BG, GB, BB. Eliminate GG since we know that there’s at least one boy. Then P(BB) = 1/3. Ask Marilyn. You are a contestant at a game show. Behind one of three doors is a car; behind the other two are goats. You pick door A. Monty Hall opens door B and reveals a goat. Monty offers you a chance to switch to door C. What should you do? Answer: SWITCH! Vietnam Draft Lottery — not as “fair” as you might think! Which is the most popular soft drink? Well, in Atlanta, we know the answer to that one! Why are some election polls so incredibly wrong? How do they do real-time updates of win probabilities as a basketball game progresses? How can you simulate randomness on a computer, and what can you use it for? How can you tell if the quality of an item that your manufacturing plant is producing has started to get worse? 8.1.3 Working Definitions Probability: Methodology that describes the random variation in systems. (We’ll spend about 50% of our time on this.) Statistics: Uses sample data to draw general conclusions about the population from which the sample was taken. (50% of our time.) 8.2 Lesson 1.2 — The Joy of Sets Bootcamp 8.2.1 Definition: A set is a collection of objects. Members of a set are called elements. 8.2.2 Notation: A, B, C, . . . for sets a, b, c, . . . for elements ∈ for membership, e.g., x ∈ A \\(\\notin\\) for non-membership, e.g., x \\(\\notin\\) A U is the universal set (i.e., everything) ∅ is the empty set. 8.2.3 Examples: A = {1, 2, . . . , 10}. 2 ∈ A; 49 \\(\\notin\\) A. B = {basketball, baseball} C = {x | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1} (“|” means “such that”) D = {x | \\(x^2\\) = 9} = {±3} (either is fine) E = {x | x ∈ \\(\\textbf{R}\\), \\(x^2\\) = −1} = ∅ (\\(\\textbf{R}\\) is the real line) 8.2.4 Definition: If every element of set A is an element of set B, then A is a subset of B, i.e., A ⊆ B. 8.2.5 Definition: A = B iff (if and only if) A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A. 8.2.6 Properties: ∅ ⊆ A; A ⊆ U; A ⊆ A (A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C) ⇒ (implies) A ⊆ C 8.2.7 Remark: The order in which the elements of a set are listed is immaterial, e.g., {a, b, c} = {b, c, a}. 8.2.8 Definitions: The complement of A with respect to U is \\(\\bar{A} ≡ \\{x | x ∈ U \\textit{and } x \\notin A\\}\\). 8.2.9 Remark: Don’t confuse complement with compliment! (“You are one fine-lookin’ set!”) The intersection of A and B is A ∩ B ≡ {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}. The union of A and B is A ∪ B ≡ {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B (or both)}. (Remember Venn diagrams?) 8.2.10 Example: Suppose U = {letters of the alphabet}, A = {vowels}?, ?We’ll ignore the fact that y and w are sometimes vowels (believe it or not)! and B = {a, b, c}. Then \\(\\bar{A}\\) = {consonants} A ∩ B = {a} A ∪ B = {a, b, c, e, i, o, u}. ✷ 8.2.11 Definition: If A ∩ B = ∅, then A and B are disjoint (or mutually exclusive). 8.2.12 Definitions: Minus: A − B ≡ A ∩ \\(\\bar{B}\\) Symmetric difference or XOR: A ∆ B ≡ (A − B) ∪ (B − A) = (A ∪ B) − (A ∩ B) Cardinality: The cardinality of A, denoted by |A|, is the number of elements in A. A is finite if |A| &lt; ∞. 8.2.13 Examples: A = {3, 4} is finite, since |A| = 2. B = {1, 2, 3, . . .} is countably infinite, i.e., |B| = \\(ℵ_0\\) (look up this symbol)! C = {x | x ∈ [0, 1]} is uncountably infinite, i.e., |C| = \\(ℵ_1\\) (look it up)! \\(ℵ_0\\), Aleph-nought 8.2.14 Laws of Operation: Complement Law: \\[A ∪ \\bar{A} = U, A ∩ \\bar{A} = ∅, \\bar{\\bar{A}} = A\\] Commutative: A ∪ B = B ∪ A, A ∩ B = B ∩ A Associative: A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C, A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C Distributive: A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C), A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C) DeMorgan’s: \\[\\overline{A ∪ B} = \\bar{A} ∩ \\bar{B}, \\\\ \\overline{A ∩ B} = \\bar{A} ∪ \\bar{B}\\] 8.2.15 Proofs: Easy.
